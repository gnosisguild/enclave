 * @title IPkVerifier
 * @notice Interface for the DkgAggregator (EVM) proof verifier.
 * @dev The DkgAggregator circuit internally verifies the node-fold and C5
 *      (pk_aggregation) sub-proofs; this on-chain wrapper verifies the final
 *      EVM proof and enforces:
 *        - the immutable recursive sub-circuit VK hashes
 *        - the aggregated public-key commitment slot
 *        - a domain-binding slot binding the proof to
 *          (chainId, this, e3Id, committeeRoot, sortedNodes, pkCommitment)
 *      and reverts on any mismatch.
