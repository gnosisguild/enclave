/**
 * @title EnclaveTicketToken (ETK)
 * @notice Non-transferable, non-delegatable ERC20Votes wrapper over a stablecoin for operator
 *         staking in the Enclave protocol.
 * @dev SECURITY NOTES
 *
 *      Underlying-blacklist risk: if the wrapped stablecoin (e.g. USDC, USDT) blacklists this
 *      contract, the wrapper cannot move underlying tokens. Withdraw, payout and slashing exits
 *      that move the underlying will revert until the blacklist is cleared. {rescueERC20}
 *      lets the owner sweep accidentally received non-underlying tokens but cannot rescue the
 *      underlying itself.
 *
 *      Registry pointer: at deployment the {registry} can be set instantly via {setRegistry}
 *      so the contract can be wired up after construction. Once {lockRegistry} is invoked any
 *      future change MUST go through {requestRegistryChange} + {activateRegistryChange} with
 *      a {REGISTRY_CHANGE_DELAY} timelock so the active registry cannot be swapped out
 *      instantly to drain operator stake.
 *
 *      EIP-6372 clock: this token uses {block.timestamp} ("mode=timestamp"). The companion
 *      {CiphernodeRegistryOwnable} records committee request timepoints in the same unit so
 *      {getPastVotes} resolves consistently against historical balances.
