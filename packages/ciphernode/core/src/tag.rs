//! Tag management for EVM event processing.
//!
//! This module provides thread-safe access to a global string tag that's used to
//! differentiate between different EVM contract instances during event processing.
//! The tag helps track and manage historical and live events for specific contracts.

/// Global tag for contract event tracking with a default value of "_".
/// This tag is initialized once and remains constant throughout the lifecycle
/// of event processing to ensure consistent event tracking across restarts.
