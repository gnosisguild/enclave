//! Aggregator liveness / failover policy.
//!
//! The active aggregator for an E3 is chosen deterministically as the lowest
//! non-skipped party in the (score-ordered) committee
//! ([`e3_events::Committee::active_aggregator_party_id`]). If that node crashes
//! after the committee is finalised but before it publishes the aggregated
//! result on-chain, the round stalls indefinitely: no on-chain expulsion is
//! triggered (the node committed no fault), so nothing demotes it.
//!
//! This module is the pure, testable brain of an automatic failover: it tracks
//! how long the *expected on-chain progress* from the active aggregator has been
//! absent and, once a wall-clock budget elapses, decides to mark the current
//! aggregator as locally unresponsive and promote the next standby. Because the
//! committee order and the skip set are derived from signals every node shares,
//! all honest nodes converge on the same replacement without a leader-election
//! round. A brief overlap (old + new aggregator both publishing) is bounded by
//! the timeout and made harmless by the on-chain publish being single-shot.
//!
//! All decisions here are deterministic given their inputs (no clock access),
//! so the policy is exercised entirely by unit tests; the driving actor owns the
//! wall clock and feeds `elapsed` in.
