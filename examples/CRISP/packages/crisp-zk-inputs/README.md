# @crisp-e3/zk-inputs

WASM bindings for generating CRISP ZK proof inputs, compiled from Rust and shared between the
server-side Node.js environment and the browser. This package lets the CRISP SDK produce the circuit
witness data needed for Noir-based vote-validity proofs without duplicating the logic in TypeScript.

## What it generates

The WASM module wraps a `ZKInputsGenerator` class that performs BFV encryption and produces the
witness data needed for CRISP's Noir circuits. Two main proof types are supported:

- **Vote proof** (`generateInputs`) — encrypts a vote under the committee's threshold BFV public key
  and produces a witness proving the vote is correctly encrypted and that the voter is eligible
  (e.g. holds the required token balance, verified via a Merkle membership proof).

- **Vote update / mask proof** (`generateInputsForUpdate`) — same structure, but used for revotes or
  masker contributions under the
  [vote masking](https://blog.theinterfold.com/vote-masking-receipt-freeness-secret-ballots/) scheme
  that provides receipt-freeness. Unlike the first-vote path, this preserves the real
  `prev_ct_commitment` (rather than zeroing it) to chain updates together.

The generator also exposes `encryptVote` / `decryptVote` for standalone BFV operations and
`generateKeys` for key generation.

These witness objects are then passed to `@noir-lang/noir_js` and `@aztec/bb.js` to generate the
actual ZK proofs.

## Usage

This package requires a universal init pattern because:

- In **Node.js** (>=18) WASM can be loaded synchronously — no preloading needed.
- In the **browser** the WASM binary must be fetched and instantiated asynchronously.

The `init` subpackage handles both environments transparently.

### ❌ Don't use the default export

```ts
// Bad — the raw default loader doesn't work in Node.js contexts
import init, { generateVoteInputs } from '@crisp-e3/zk-inputs'
```

### ✅ Use the universal subpackage loader

```ts
import init from '@crisp-e3/zk-inputs/init'
import { generateVoteInputs } from '@crisp-e3/zk-inputs'

await init()
const inputs = generateVoteInputs(/* ... */)
```

Call `init()` once before any other imports from `@crisp-e3/zk-inputs`. In browser environments
`init()` fetches the WASM binary; in Node.js it is a no-op.

## Building

The WASM bundle is compiled from the Rust source in `crates/crisp-zk-inputs` using `wasm-pack`:

```bash
# From the CRISP root
pnpm build:wasm
```
