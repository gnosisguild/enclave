A "Ciphernode" is a software system that is built using the [Actor Model of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) (See [[The Actor Model]])

Ciphernodes are therefore comprised of small actors that handle and dispatch events to interact and manage state computation. Here is an incomplete list of some of the actors that make up the main functionality of a Ciphernode:
