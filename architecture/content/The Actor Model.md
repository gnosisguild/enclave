The Actor Model is a computational model that treats "actors" as the fundamental units of concurrent computation. In this model, actors are isolated, lightweight entities that communicate exclusively through asynchronous message passing, with each actor maintaining its own private state and processing messages sequentially. When an actor receives a message, it can perform computations, send messages to other actors, create new actors, or modify its own behavior for handling future messages. This approach eliminates shared mutable state, which is a common source of complexity and bugs in concurrent systems. The Actor Model is particularly well-suited for event-driven peer-to-peer systems because it naturally maps to the decentralized, message-passing nature of P2P networks, where each peer can be modeled as an actor that responds to network events and communicates asynchronously with other peers without requiring centralized coordination. In frameworks like Actix, parallel workloads can be managed using arbiters, which are single-threaded event loops that provide execution contexts for actors, allowing the system to distribute actors across multiple threads while maintaining message-passing isolation.
