This section provides a breakdown of Enclave’s architecture, focusing on the essential components
and workflows to help you implement it effectively.

## Core Components

### 1. Key Actors

#### Requesters

- Initiate and define computation requests, including parameters and requirements
- Retrieve and utilize final computation results
- Can be applications or other entities

#### Data Providers

- Supply private input data required for computation
- Are responsible for encrypting data before submission
- Can be end users, systems, or other applications

#### Ciphernodes

- Provide cryptographic services as staked network nodes
- Handle distributed key generation and decryption operations
- Form Ciphernode Committees (CiCos) for specific computations

### 2. Smart Contracts

#### Enclave Contract

- Central coordinator of the E3 ecosystem
- Manages computation requests and lifecycle
- Coordinates Ciphernode selection and CiCo formation
- Maintains input integrity via Merkle trees
- Emits events for off-chain services

#### E3 Program (E3P) Contract

- Defines computation logic
- Validates program parameters
- Verifies computation proofs
- Interfaces with the Enclave contract
- Ensures correct execution of the E3P
- Validates and sanitizes input data
  - this might involve verifying a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to ensure data integrity and
    authenticity
  - prevents malicious input injection that could compromise the computation

#### Decryption Verifier Contract

- Validates Ciphernode decryption shares
- Ensures correct result decryption
- Verifies threshold signature schemes

### 3. Compute Infrastructure

#### Compute Provider (CP)

- Runs the E3 Program over the published inputs
- Reports computation reults of the E3P to the Enclave contract

Enclave supports multiple CPs with a variety of different trust, scalability, and cost properties.

**Supported systems:**

1. **Verifiable Systems**
   - [RISC Zero zkVM](https://www.risczero.com/)
   - [Succint SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/) (coming soon)
   - [Jolt](https://jolt.a16zcrypto.com/) (coming soon)

2. **Oracle-Based Systems**
   - zkTLS VMs (coming soon)
   - Committee-based oracles (coming soon)
   - Game theory-based oracles (coming soon)

## Interaction Flow

The following steps outline how these components interact in a typical computation:

1. **Computation Request**: A Requester submits a computation request with specific parameters.
2. **Node Selection**: Ciphernodes are selected via sortition to form a Ciphernode Committee (CiCo).
3. **Key Generation**: The CiCo generates and publishes a shared public key for encryption.
4. **Data Submission**: Data Providers encrypt their inputs using the CiCo's shared public key and
   publish commitments to the encrypted inputs onchain.
5. **Computation Execution**: The Compute Provider (CP) runs the E3 Program (E3P) over the published
   inputs.
6. **Decryption**: The CiCo collectively decrypts the final result.
7. **Result Retrieval**: The Requester retrieves and consumes the decrypted output of the E3P.

## Developer's Perspective

As a developer, you'll interact with:

- **Enclave's Smart Contracts**: To submit requests and retrieve results.
- **Compute Providers**: To run your E3P using verfiable or oracle-based systems.
- **E3 Smart Contracts**: To verify the inputs and computation result.
