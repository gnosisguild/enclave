# Compute Provider (CP)

Compute Providers form the modular compute layer of the Enclave protocol, allowing you to choose the
optimal balance of trust, cost, and scalability for your application. CPs are responsible for
running your E3 Program's Secure Process and reporting results back to your E3 Program's smart
contract.

### Choosing a Compute Provider

CPs fall into two broad categories:

1. **Verifiable:** Secured by cryptographic guarantees, produce outputs that are provable onchain.
2. **Oracle-Based:** Secured by trusted attestations, consensus mechanisms, and/or economic games.

Select a CP that suits your needs. Options include:

**Verifiable**

- [RISC Zero zkVM](https://www.risczero.com/)
- [Succint SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/) (coming soon)
- [Jolt](https://jolt.a16zcrypto.com/) (coming soon)

**Oracle-Based Systems**

- zkTLS VMs (coming soon)
- Committee-based oracles (coming soon)
- Game theory-based oracles (coming soon)

**Custom**

- You can also implement your own custom CP. From Enclave's perspective, it simply requires a
  contract that conforms to `IComputeProvider`.

**Factors to Consider:**

- **Verifiability**: Consider whether or not your use case requires cryptographic guarantees of
  correct execution.
- **Cost**: Verifiable CPs will incur higher compute overhead, which may translate to increased
  costs for your users.
- **Performance**: Verifiable systems will often be less performant compared to oracle-based CPs.
- **Language Support**: Choose a CP that supports the programming languages you're comfortable with.

Enclave provides a
[Compute Provider package](https://github.com/gnosisguild/CRISP/tree/main/packages/ciphernode/compute-provider)
to simplify the integration, letting you focus on computation logic. More details can be found in
the [Writing the Secure Process](./write-secure-program.mdx) guide.

### Setup

In this guide, we'll go over setting up [RISC Zero](https://www.risczero.com/) as the CP.

RISC Zero provides a [Foundry template](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-foundry-template) that can be
used to run the Secure Process and create a ZK proof. The template includes a basic program that can
be used to get started with the smart contract code to verify the proof.

Follow the instructions in the [Foundry template](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-foundry-template)
to setup RISC Zero.

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation/)

```sh
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, you will use `rzup` to install `cargo-risczero`.

To install `rzup`, run the following command and follow the instructions:

```sh
curl -L https://risczero.com/install | bash
```

Next we can install the RISC Zero toolchain by running `rzup`:

```sh
rzup
```

You can verify the installation was successful by running:

```sh
cargo risczero --version
```

Now you're ready to develop and deploy applications using RISC Zero as your CP.
