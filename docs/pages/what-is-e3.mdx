## Encrypted Execution Environment (E3)

An **Encrypted Execution Environment (E3)** is a decentralized framework designed to allow secure
computation over encrypted data from multiple sources. E3s ensure data privacy and computational
integrity by combining three essential components:

1. **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):** Enables computations directly on encrypted data without
   needing to decrypt it, maintaining security from start to finish.
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Allow verification of data and computations without revealing
   sensitive information, offering a way to validate accuracy while preserviing privacy.
3. **Distributed Threshold Cryptography (DTC):** Distributes cryptographic keys across multiple
   nodes, eliminating single points of failure and enhancing the frameworkâ€™s resilience against
   breaches.

Together, these components create a secure, verifiable framework for privacy-preserving computation.

### When to Use E3

E3s are ideal for scenarios where you want to:

- Compute over sensitive data from multiple parties without taking custody of the plaintext data.
- Ensure compliance with data protection laws like GDPR or HIPAA.
- Reduce liability when interacting with sensitive data.
- Derive insights from otherwise inaccessible or sensitive datasets.
- Eliminate trust in any single party or hardware component.

### Practical Use Cases

- **Secret Ballots**: Implement verifiable and private voting systems.
- **Secure Data Analysis**: Perform computations on private datasets without taking custody of raw
  data.
- **Collaborative Research**: Enable multiple organizations to securely aggregate and analyze data
  without mutual data sharing.

### How E3 Works for Developers

As a developer, interacting with an E3 involves:

- Defining the computation logic (E3 Program).
- Configuring parameters for the execution environment.
- Submitting encrypted data inputs.
- Retrieving and verifying the computation results.

Each of these steps will be covered in detail in the following sections.
