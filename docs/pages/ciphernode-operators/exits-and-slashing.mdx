# Exits, Rewards & Slashing

Understand how to collect rewards, respond to slashing proposals, and exit the registry safely.

## Rewards

- Distributed via `BondingRegistry.distributeRewards` (any ERC20)
- Watch for `RewardsDistributed(e3Id, nodes, amounts)` events
- Ensure the operator wallet remains funded to claim rewards if additional gas is required

## Slashing lifecycle

1. `SlashingManager` emits `SlashProposed` referencing a policy + reason code.
2. Operators inspect the evidence (if any) and the associated `SlashPolicy` parameters.
3. File an appeal with `fileAppeal(e3Id, reason, evidenceURI)` before `appealWindow` expires, if the
   policy allows it.
4. Once finalized, penalties may burn tickets, confiscate license bonds, and optionally ban the
   operator.

Stay alert for:

- `appealWindow` values per policy (some reasons skip appeals entirely)
- `updateBanStatus` (governance must lift bans before re-registration)

## Exit process

1. Call `deregisterOperator(bytes32[] calldata siblingProof)`
   - The proof removes the operator from the registry's incremental Merkle tree (IMT)
   - Capture it via the CLI logs, `CiphernodeAdded` events, or by querying the registry
2. Tickets burn immediately; license bonds enter the exit queue with an unlock timestamp
3. Wait for the configured delay (`exitDelay`, 7 days on Sepolia)
4. Claim funds with `claimExits(uint256 maxTickets, uint256 maxLicense)`
   - Use `pendingExits(address)` or `previewClaimable(address)` to check readiness

## Health checklist

| Symptom | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| `ExitNotReady` on `claimExits` | Confirm `block.timestamp` passed `exitUnlocksAt` and delay. Call `previewClaimable`. |
| Slashing appeal rejected immediately | Policy likely disables appeals. Review policy metadata. |
| `isActive` toggles false unexpectedly | Check ticket balance (>= 1) and verify bonded ENCL >= 80% requirement. |
| Missed reward payouts | Ensure registry still lists the operator, RPC did not drop events, and reward token address is supported. |

## Post-exit

- Securely wipe local secrets (`enclave nodes purge` and delete keystores)
- Revoke RPC credentials and firewall openings
- Document the exit reason for future audits or compliance
