# Ciphernode Operators

Ciphernodes decrypt committee outputs, publish threshold key shares, and keep the Enclave request
pipeline moving. This section organizes everything operators need—from bonding requirements to exit
procedures—into focused guides.

## Role overview

Operators are expected to:

- Maintain a QUIC/libp2p endpoint that stays reachable 24/7
- Bond license collateral (ENCL) and hold ticket balances (ETK) to remain eligible for committees
- Stay synced with the event bus so sortition submissions and key shares happen on time
- Produce decryption shares for every E3 assigned to their committee
- Monitor slashing proposals, appeals, and rewards distribution

Each node profile in `enclave.config.yaml` can point to a different network (mainnet, testnet, or
local dev). The CLI supervises all configured chains concurrently.
