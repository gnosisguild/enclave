# Running a Ciphernode

This guide walks you through setting up and running a ciphernode, then explains the complete
computation flow from E3 request to plaintext decryption.

## Setup: Initialize Your Ciphernode

Start by running `enclave init` to create the initial configuration:

```bash
enclave init
```

This command will:

- Create `~/.config/enclave/config.yaml` with your node configuration
- Generate a network keypair in `~/.config/enclave/key`
- Set up the data directory at `~/.local/share/enclave/`

During initialization, you'll be prompted for:

- Your Ethereum address (the address that will participate in committees)
- A password to encrypt sensitive data
- RPC URL for the chain you want to connect to

## Configuration

After initialization, edit your `~/.config/enclave/config.yaml` to configure:

### 1. Contract Addresses

Update the contract addresses to match the network you're connecting to:

```yaml
chains:
  - name: sepolia
    rpc_url: 'wss://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com'
    contracts:
      enclave:
        address: '0x1E8B…FAa6'
        deploy_block: 9615399
      ciphernode_registry:
        address: '0x11F6…0b1C7'
      bonding_registry:
        address: '0x5636…406E3'
      fee_token:
        address: '0xB58B…4De0'
```

### 2. Bootstrap Peers

Add at least one bootstrap peer to join the network:

```yaml
node:
  address: '0xYourAddress'
  quic_port: 9201
  peers:
    - '/dns4/bootstrap.enclave.gg/udp/9091/quic-v1'
  autonetkey: true
  autopassword: true
```

### 3. Set Your Wallet

Configure your private key to sign transactions:

```bash
enclave wallet set --private-key "0xYourPrivateKey"
```

**Warning:** Never share your private key. Keep it secure.

## Starting Your Node

Once configured, start your ciphernode:

```bash
enclave start
```

Your node will:

- Connect to the bootstrap peer(s)
- Subscribe to blockchain events
- Begin participating in sortition when E3s are requested

## The Complete E3 Flow

Here's what happens when an E3 (Encrypted Execution Environment) computation is requested:

### Phase 1: E3 Request

1. Someone calls `request()` on the Enclave contract with computation parameters
2. A new E3 ID is created with a random seed
3. The contract emits an `E3Requested` event

### Phase 2: Committee Selection (Sortition)

1. **Ticket Submission**: Your ciphernode listens for `E3Requested` events
2. **Score Calculation**: Your node calculates a sortition score based on:
   - The E3 seed
   - Your tickets/stake
   - Your node's tickets
3. **Committee Finalization**: The top N nodes with the best scores are selected
4. If selected, you'll receive a `CommitteeFinalized` event with your party ID

### Phase 3: Keyshare Generation

When your node is selected for a committee:

1. **Generate Secret**: Your node generates a secret key share and public key share
2. **Publish Keyshare**: The public key share is broadcast via libp2p and published onchain
3. **Storage**: The secret is encrypted and stored in `~/.local/share/enclave/jobs/<e3_id>/`

### Phase 4: Public Key Aggregation

1. **Collect Keyshares**: An aggregator node collects all N public key shares from the committee
2. **Aggregate**: Once all shares are received, they're combined into a single public encryption key
3. **Publish**: The aggregated public key is published onchain via `publishPublicKey()`
4. The contract emits `PublicKeyAggregated` event
5. The E3 is now activated and ready to receive encrypted inputs

### Phase 5: Input Window

During this phase:

1. Data providers encrypt their inputs using the aggregated public key
2. They submit encrypted data to the contract via `publishInput()`
3. The E3 Program validates each input
4. Input hashes are added to a Merkle tree onchain

### Phase 6: Computation

1. **Deadline Passes**: Once the input window closes, computation can begin
2. **Compute Provider Execution**: A compute provider (or E3 program) retrieves all encrypted inputs
3. **FHE Computation**: The computation runs entirely on encrypted data
4. **Output Generation**: The result is produced as encrypted ciphertext with a ZK proof

### Phase 7: Ciphertext Publishing

1. The compute provider calls `publishCiphertextOutput()` with the encrypted result and proof
2. The contract verifies the proof
3. Contract emits `CiphertextOutputPublished` event
4. All committee members are notified to begin decryption

### Phase 8: Decryption Share Generation

When your ciphernode receives `CiphertextOutputPublished`:

1. **Load Secret**: Your node retrieves the encrypted secret key share from storage
2. **Decrypt Secret**: The secret is decrypted using your node's cipher
3. **Generate Share**: Your node creates a decryption share by partially decrypting the ciphertext
4. **Publish Share**: The decryption share is broadcast via libp2p and published onchain
5. Your node emits `DecryptionshareCreated` event

### Phase 9: Plaintext Aggregation

1. **Collect Shares**: An aggregator node collects decryption shares from committee members
2. **Threshold Met**: Once M-of-N threshold shares are received (e.g., 3 of 5)
3. **Aggregate**: The aggregator combines the shares to decrypt the final plaintext
4. **Publish Result**: The plaintext is published onchain via `publishPlaintextOutput()`
5. Contract emits `PlaintextOutputPublished` event
6. **Rewards**: Committee members receive their rewards for successful completion

### Phase 10: Completion

1. The plaintext output is now available onchain
2. Anyone can query `getE3()` to retrieve the result
3. Your node clears the secret from memory
4. The E3 round is complete

## Monitoring Your Node

### Check Node Status

```bash
# View logs
journalctl -u enclave -f

# Check if your node is running
ps aux | grep enclave
```

### What to Watch For

Your node logs will show:

- `E3Requested` - New computation request detected
- `TicketGenerated` - Your sortition ticket was calculated
- `CiphernodeSelected` - You were selected for a committee
- `KeyshareCreated` - Your keyshare was generated
- `PublicKeyAggregated` - Committee public key is ready
- `CiphertextOutputPublished` - Time to generate decryption share
- `DecryptionshareCreated` - Your decryption share was published
- `PlaintextAggregated` - Final result is available

## Important Notes

### Stay Online

- Your node must be online and responsive during all phases of an E3 you're selected for
- Missing keyshare publication or decryption share submission may result in slashing

### Network Connectivity

- Ensure your `quic_port` (UDP) is accessible from the internet
- Maintain stable connections to bootstrap peers
- Consider running your own bootstrap node for redundancy

### RPC Reliability

- Use reliable RPC endpoints (consider running your own node)
- Have backup RPC URLs configured
- Monitor RPC connectivity and switch if needed

### Data Persistence

- The `~/.local/share/enclave/` directory contains critical job data
- Back up this directory regularly
- Do not delete data for active E3s

### Key Security

- Your network keypair is stored in `~/.config/enclave/key`
- Your wallet private key is encrypted in the config
- Never share these files or your private keys
