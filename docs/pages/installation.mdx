# Installation

This guide covers how to install the Enclave CLI and get your development environment set up.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Enclave, make sure you have the following dependencies:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the Enclave CLI is using our installer script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnosisguild/enclave/main/install | bash
```

Or if you prefer `wget`:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnosisguild/enclave/main/install | bash
```

This script will download and install `enclaveup`, which is the standalone installer for the Enclave CLI.

## Using enclaveup

Once you have `enclaveup` installed, you can manage your Enclave CLI installation:

### Install the Enclave CLI

```bash
# Install to ~/.local/bin (default)
enclaveup install

# Install to /usr/local/bin (requires sudo)
enclaveup install --system
```

Running `enclaveup install` will install the latest version of the Enclave CLI.
See `enclaveup --help` for more options.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

1. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave/releases)
2. Download the appropriate binary for your platform:
   - Linux: `enclave-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
   - macOS: `enclave-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`
3. Extract the binary and place it in your PATH (e.g., `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`)
4. Make sure the binary is executable: `chmod +x enclave`

## Platform Support

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Linux | x86_64 | ✅ Native binary |
| macOS | Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) | ✅ Native binary |
| macOS | Intel | ✅ Via Rosetta 2 |

*Note: Intel Macs automatically run Apple Silicon binaries through Rosetta 2 translation.*


### Building from Source

If you need to build `enclave` from source:
1. Ensure you have Rust installed (using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave.git
cd enclave
```

3. Build the binary

```bash
cargo install --path ./crates/cli --bin enclave -f
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that the Enclave CLI is working correctly:

```bash
enclave --help
```

You should see the help information for the Enclave CLI.
