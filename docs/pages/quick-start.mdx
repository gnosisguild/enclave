# Quick Start

Get your first E3 program running on the Enclave Protocol! This guide assumes you have the [Enclave CLI installed](/installation).

## Prerequisites Check

Make sure you have the required software installed:

```bash
# Check versions
docker --version    # Should be 25.0.6+
node --version      # Should be 22.10.0+
pnpm --version      # Should be 10.7.1+
rustc --version     # Should be 1.86.0+
enclave --version   # Confirm CLI is installed
```

## 1. Create Your Project

Generate a new E3 program from the default template:

```bash
enclave init my-first-e3
cd my-first-e3
```

This creates a complete E3 project with:
- **FHE computation logic** (`./program/`)
- **Smart contracts** (`./contracts/`)
- **Client application** (`./client/`)
- **Coordination server** (`./server/`)
- **Configuration** (`enclave.config.yaml`)

## 2. Compile Your E3 Program

First, compile your E3 program to build the Risc0 zkvm image:

```bash
enclave program compile
```

This builds the Risc0 zkvm image that will be deployed on the blockchain and used for verification of the final proof.

## 3. Start the Development Environment

Launch all services with one command:

```bash
pnpm dev:all
```

This starts:
- Local Ethereum network (Hardhat)
- Deploys all the smart contracts to the local network
- Multiple ciphernodes for FHE processing
- TypeScript coordination server
- FHE program server
- Frontend client application

**Wait for all services to start** (usually 30-60 seconds).

## 4. Access Your Application

1. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Configure MetaMask for local development:
   - Network: `http://localhost:8545`
   - Chain ID: `31337`

## 5. Test the FHE Computation

The default template includes a simple addition program that:

1. **Encrypts** two numbers on the client
2. **Computes** their sum using FHE (without decrypting)
3. **Returns** the encrypted result
4. **Decrypts** and displays the result

Try it:
- Input two numbers in the web interface
- Click "Submit"
- Watch the encrypted computation happen!

## What Just Happened?

You successfully ran a **Fully Homomorphic Encryption** computation where:

- Your inputs were encrypted before leaving the browser
- The computation happened on encrypted data
- The result was computed without exposing your private inputs
- All coordination was handled by the Enclave protocol

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working E3 program:

1. **Explore the code**: Check out `./program/src/lib.rs` to see the FHE computation
2. **Modify the computation**: Try changing the addition to multiplication
3. **Update the UI**: Customize the client in `./client/src/`
4. **Deploy**: Learn about production deployment
