# Build an E3 Program

Enclave's Encrypted Execution Environments (E3) are a powerful way to run code over securely
encrypted data, producing meaningful combined outputs without exposing sensitive inputs. This guide
will walk you through building an E3 Program, covering:

1. Setting up a Compute Provider.
2. Writing the Secure Process for your E3 Program.
3. Implementing the required smart contract components.
4. Exploring possible client implementations.

Enclave's network of Ciphernodes and client-side encryption tools handle much of the complexity,
allowing you to focus solely on the logic of your specific E3 Program.

Let's begin by setting up a Compute Provider.
