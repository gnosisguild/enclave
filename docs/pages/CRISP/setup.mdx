# Getting Started with CRISP

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run CRISP locally. CRISP is a complete
example of an E3 Program, built with a modern Hardhat-based architecture that includes smart
contracts, frontend applications, and secure computation components.

The setup includes the following:

- **CRISP contracts**: Smart contracts located in the `contracts/` directory
- **Applications**: Frontend, server, and computation programs in the `apps/` directory
- **Ciphernodes**: Distributed nodes managed through the Enclave CLI
- **Development environment**: Hardhat + Foundry hybrid setup

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have installed:

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh)
- [RiscZero](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io)

### Install Node

You can install Node following the official [documentation](https://nodejs.org/en) or using a Node
Version Manager (e.g., [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).

### Install Pnpm

You can install Pnpm following the official [documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Install Metamask

You can add Metamask as extension to your browser following the official
[documentation](https://metamask.io).

### Install Rust and Foundry

You need to install Rust and Foundry first. After installation, restart your terminal.

```sh
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

### Install RISC Zero Toolchain

Next, install `rzup` for the `cargo-risczero` toolchain.

```sh
# Install rzup
curl -L https://risczero.com/install | bash

# Install RISC Zero toolchain
rzup install cargo-risczero
```

Verify the installation was successful by running:

```sh
cargo risczero --version
```

At this point, you should have all the tools required to develop and deploy an application with
[RISC Zero](https://www.risczero.com).

## Environment

You need to setup your environment variables for `client/` and `server/`. Just copy and paste the
`.env.default` as `.env` and overwrite with your values the following variables (you can leave the
others initialized with the default values).

### Client

```bash
VITE_E3_PROGRAM_ADDRESS=0x322813Fd9A801c5507c9de605d63CEA4f2CE6c44 # Default E3 program address from anvil
VITE_SEMAPHORE_ADDRESS=0x9A9f2CCfdE556A7E9Ff0848998Aa4a0CFD8863AE
```

### Server

```bash
ENCLAVE_ADDRESS="0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512"
CIPHERNODE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS="0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9"
NAIVE_REGISTRY_FILTER_ADDRESS="0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9"
E3_PROGRAM_ADDRESS="0x322813Fd9A801c5507c9de605d63CEA4f2CE6c44" # CRISPProgram Contract Address
```

These address will be displayed after successfully running the `pnpm dev:up` command in a log that
will look like the following:

```bash
[DEPLOY] Script ran successfully.

```

If you find any inconsistency with the addresses on the environment, you must update them and run
the script again (they must match).

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get CRISP running is using the scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Setup and build the development environment
pnpm dev:setup

# Start all services (Anvil, Ciphernodes, Applications)
pnpm dev:up

# Clean up all artifacts and generated output (e.g., builds)
# This must be run from enclave root (do cd ../../ if you are inside examples/CRISP)
pnpm clean
```

This will start all CRISP components:

- Anvil (local blockchain)
- Deploy all contracts
- Compile all ZK circuits
- Ciphernodes network
- CRISP applications (server, client)

```bash
# Build the development containers
pnpm dev:setup

# Start all services
pnpm dev:up

# Rebuild containers
pnpm dev:build

# Invoke the Server CLI
pnpm cli
```

Once everything is running, you can:

1. Navigate `http://localhost:3000` for the client interface
2. Add the Anvil private key to your wallet:
   `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`
3. Press `Connect Wallet` button and complete the association with your MetaMask account
4. Switch to `Anvil` local network (this will be handled automatically by the app. You just need to
   press on the connected account on the frontend and select the network. Then, complete the
   configuration on MetaMask pop-up).
5. Open a new terminal, run `pnpm cli` and start a new E3 Round.
6. Refresh and interact with the round following the Client interface.

## Manual Start

If you prefer to set up CRISP manually or want to understand each component:

### Setting Up the project

1. Navigate to the root directory:

   ```sh
   cd examples/CRISP
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

### Setting Up the Web App

To set up the CRISP dApp in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```sh
   cd examples/CRISP/client
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Setting Up the CRISP Server

Setting up the CRISP server involves several components, but this guide will walk you through each
step.

### Step 1: Start a Local Testnet with Anvil

```sh
anvil
```

Keep Anvil running in the terminal, and open a new terminal for the next steps.

### Step 2: Setting Up the Ciphernodes

1. Clone the [Enclave Repo](https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `enclave-contracts` directory:

   ```sh
   cd enclave/packages/enclave-contracts
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Delete any previous local deployment (if any):

   ```sh
   rm -rf deployments/localhost/
   ```

5. Deploy the contracts on the local testnet:

   ```sh
   pnpm deploy:mocks --network localhost
   ```

After deployment, you will see the addresses for the following contracts:

- Enclave
- Ciphernode Registry
- Naive Registry Filter
- Mock Input Validator
- Mock E3 Program
- Mock Decryption Verifier
- Mock Compute Provider

Note down the first four addresses as they will be needed to configure `risc0`, `local_testnet` and
the `server`.

### Step 3: Deploy the RISC Zero Contracts

> Please note that this step is optional for development only. You can run the program server in dev
> mode which does not use Risc0.

1. Navigate to the `CRISP/lib/risc0-ethereum` directory.

**Faster Proving w/ Bonsai**

The following steps are optional. You can config
[Bonsai](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/remote-proving) for faster proving.

- Set up environment variables by creating a `.cargo` directory and `config.toml` file:

  ```sh
  mkdir .cargo && cd .cargo && touch config.toml
  ```

- Add the following configuration to `config.toml`:

  > **_Note:_** _This requires having access to a Bonsai API Key. To request an API key
  > [complete the form here](https://bonsai.xyz/apply)._

  ```toml
  [env]
  BONSAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
  BONSAI_API_URL="your_api_url"
  ```

---

2. In the `risc0/script` directory, update the `config.toml` with the deployed contract addresses.
   The following configuration is based on default deployment addresses using local Anvil node:

   ```toml
   [profile.custom]
   chainId = 31337
   riscZeroVerifierAddress = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
   enclaveAddress = "0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512"
   inputValidatorAddress = "0xa513E6E4b8f2a923D98304ec87F64353C4D5C853"
   ```

3. Export the ETH_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable (Anvil's default private key):

   ```sh
   export ETH_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"
   ```

4. Deploy the contracts:

   ```sh
   forge script --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast script/Deploy.s.sol
   ```

Note down the `CRISPProgram` contract Address, which will be used as the E3 Program Address.

### Step 4: Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following:

```sh
# Private key for the enclave server
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
ENCLAVE_SERVER_URL=http://0.0.0.0:4000
HTTP_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
PROGRAM_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:13151
WS_RPC_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8545
CHAIN_ID=31337

# Cron-job API key to trigger new rounds
CRON_API_KEY=1234567890

# Based on Default Anvil Deployments (Only for testing)
ENCLAVE_ADDRESS="0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512"
CIPHERNODE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS="0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9"
NAIVE_REGISTRY_FILTER_ADDRESS="0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9"
E3_PROGRAM_ADDRESS="0x322813Fd9A801c5507c9de605d63CEA4f2CE6c44" # CRISPProgram Contract Address

# E3 Config
E3_WINDOW_SIZE=40
E3_THRESHOLD_MIN=1
E3_THRESHOLD_MAX=2
E3_DURATION=160

# E3 Compute Provider Config
E3_COMPUTE_PROVIDER_NAME="RISC0"
E3_COMPUTE_PROVIDER_PARALLEL=false
E3_COMPUTE_PROVIDER_BATCH_SIZE=4 # Must be a power of 2
```

## Running Ciphernodes

To run three ciphernodes, use the following command inside the CRISP directory:

```sh
./scripts/dev_cipher.sh
```

This script will start the ciphernodes, add the ciphernodes to the registry on chain.

## Running the CRISP Server

To run the CRISP Server, open a new terminal and navigate to the `server` directory. Then, execute
the following command:

```sh
cargo run --bin server
```

## Interacting with CRISP via CLI

Open a new terminal and navigate to the `server` directory. Then, execute the following command:

```sh
cargo run --bin cli
```

Once the CLI client is running, you can interact with the CRISP voting protocol by following these
steps:

1. Select `CRISP: Voting Protocol (ETH)` from the menu.

2. To initiate a new CRISP round, choose the option `Initialize new CRISP round`.

Ensure all services are running correctly and that components are communicating as expected before
starting a new CRISP round.

## Next Steps

Once you have completed the setup, you can proceed to [Running an E3 Program](/CRISP/running-e3) to
learn how to interact with CRISP and run voting rounds.
