# Getting Started with CRISP

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run CRISP locally. CRISP is a complete example of an E3 Program, built with a modern Hardhat-based architecture that includes smart contracts, frontend applications, and secure computation components.

The setup includes the following:

- **CRISP contracts**: Smart contracts located in the `contracts/` directory
- **Applications**: Frontend, server, and computation programs in the `apps/` directory
- **Ciphernodes**: Distributed nodes managed through the Enclave CLI
- **Development environment**: Hardhat + Foundry hybrid setup

## Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get CRISP running is using the Docker development environment:

```sh
# Clone the repository first
git clone https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave.git
cd enclave

# Navigate to the CRISP example
cd examples/CRISP

# Setup and build the development environment
pnpm dev:setup

# Start all services (Anvil, Ciphernodes, Applications)
pnpm dev:up
```

This will:
- Build all necessary Docker containers
- Start Anvil (local blockchain)
- Deploy all contracts
- Start the ciphernode network
- Launch all CRISP applications

**Available Docker Commands:**
- `pnpm dev:setup` - Build the development containers
- `pnpm dev:up` - Start all services
- `pnpm dev:down` - Stop and clean up all services
- `pnpm dev:build` - Rebuild containers
- `pnpm cli` - Invoke the Server CLI inside the Docker Container

Once everything is running, you can:
1. Run `pnpm cli` to start a new E3 Round.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` for the client interface
3. Configure MetaMask with the Anvil network (see [MetaMask Setup](#metamask-setup) below)
4. Start voting!

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up CRISP manually or want to understand each component:

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the Enclave repository which contains the CRISP example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave.git
cd enclave
```

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Rust** (programming language and package manager)
- **Foundry** (Ethereum development framework)
- **RISC Zero toolchain** (for RISC Zero program development)
- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime for client-side dependencies)
- **Anvil** (local Ethereum node)
- **Enclave CLI** (for managing ciphernodes)

## Install Dependencies

### Install Enclave CLI

The recommended way to install the Enclave CLI is using our installer script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnosisguild/enclave/main/install | bash
```

This will install `enclaveup`, which can then install the Enclave CLI:

```sh
enclaveup install
```

For more installation options and details, see the [Installation Guide](/installation).

**Alternative: Build from Source**

If you prefer to build from source:

```sh
cargo install --locked --path ./crates/cli --bin enclave -f
```

### Install Rust and Foundry

First, install Rust and Foundry. After installation, restart your terminal.

```sh
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

### Install RISC Zero Toolchain

Next, install `rzup`, which provides the `cargo-risczero` toolchain.

```sh
# Install rzup
curl -L https://risczero.com/install | bash

# Install the RISC Zero toolchain
rzup
```

Verify the installation by running the following command:

```sh
cargo risczero --version
```

At this point, you should have all the necessary tools to develop and deploy applications with [RISC Zero](https://www.risczero.com).

## Setting Up the Client

The Client is a React application used to interact with the CRISP Server. Follow these steps to set it up locally:

1. Navigate to the client directory (from the cloned repository root):

   ```sh
   cd examples/CRISP/apps/client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Setting Up the CRISP Server

The CRISP server setup involves several components. This guide will walk you through each step.

<Steps>

### Start a Local Testnet with Anvil

1. In a terminal, start a local Ethereum testnet using Anvil:

   ```sh
   anvil
   ```

Keep this terminal open and running. Open a new terminal for the next steps.

### Deploy the Enclave Contracts

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Navigate to the `packages/evm` directory:

   ```sh
   cd packages/evm
   ```

3. Deploy the Enclave contracts on the local testnet:

   ```sh
   rm -rf deployments/localhost
   pnpm deploy:mocks --network localhost
   ```

After deployment, take note of the addresses for the following contracts:

- **Enclave**: Main protocol contract
- **Ciphernode Registry**: Registry for compute nodes
- **Filter Registry**: Registry for computation filters
- **Mock Input Validator**: Development input validation

### Deploy the CRISP Contracts

1. Navigate to the CRISP directory (from the cloned repository root):

   ```sh
   cd examples/CRISP
   ```

2. Set up the environment variables by exporting the ETH wallet private key (Anvil's default private key):

   ```sh
   export ETH_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"
   ```

3. **Optional**: Set up Bonsai for faster proving (requires API key):

   > **_Note:_** _You can request a Bonsai API Key [here](https://bonsai.xyz/apply)._

   ```sh
   export BONSAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export BONSAI_API_URL="your_api_url"
   ```

4. Deploy the CRISP contracts using Foundry:

   ```sh
   FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge script --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast deploy/Deploy.s.sol
   ```

Make sure to take note of the **CRISP Program Contract Address**, as this will serve as the **E3 Program Address**.

### Set Up Ciphernodes

Start the ciphernodes using the Enclave CLI:

1. Set up the aggregator wallet:

   ```sh
   enclave wallet set --name ag --private-key "0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"
   ```

2. Start the ciphernode network:

   ```sh
   enclave nodes up -v
   ```

3. Add ciphernodes to the registry:

   ```sh
   # Navigate back to the Enclave repository root
   cd ../../packages/evm

   # Add the ciphernodes
   pnpm ciphernode:add --ciphernode-address "0xbDA5747bFD65F08deb54cb465eB87D40e51B197E" --network "localhost"
   pnpm ciphernode:add --ciphernode-address "0xdD2FD4581271e230360230F9337D5c0430Bf44C0" --network "localhost"
   pnpm ciphernode:add --ciphernode-address "0x2546BcD3c84621e976D8185a91A922aE77ECEc30" --network "localhost"
   ```

### Configuration

The CRISP project uses an `enclave.config.yaml` file that defines:

- **Chains**: Network configuration (Hardhat/Anvil)
- **Contract addresses**: Enclave, Ciphernode Registry, Filter Registry
- **Nodes**: Configuration for ciphernodes (cn1, cn2, cn3) and aggregator (ag)

The default configuration is already set up for local development with Anvil.

</Steps>

## MetaMask Setup

To interact with CRISP through the web interface, configure MetaMask:

1. **Add the Anvil private key** to your wallet:
   ```
   0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
   ```

2. **Add the local Anvil network**:
   - Network Name: `Anvil Local`
   - RPC URL: `http://localhost:8545`
   - Chain ID: `31337`
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`

3. **Connect to the application** at `http://localhost:3000`
