# Getting Started with CRISP

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run CRISP locally. CRISP is a complete example of an E3 Program, and setting it up involves installing dependencies and deploying both the RISC Zero contracts and Enclave contracts.

The setup includes the following:

- RISC Zero contracts located in the `CRISP/packages/risc0` directory.
- Ciphernodes (Enclave, Registry, etc.) located in the `evm` directory of the [Enclave Repo](https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Rust** (programming language and package manager)
- **Foundry** (Ethereum development framework)
- **RISC Zero toolchain** (for RISC Zero program development)
- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime for client-side dependencies)
- **Anvil** (local Ethereum node)

## Install Dependencies

### Install Rust and Foundry

First, install Rust and Foundry. After installation, restart your terminal.

```sh
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

### Install RISC Zero Toolchain

Next, install `rzup`, which provides the `cargo-risczero` toolchain.

```sh
# Install rzup
curl -L https://risczero.com/install | bash

# Install the RISC Zero toolchain
rzup
```

Verify the installation by running the following command:

```sh
cargo risczero --version
```

At this point, you should have all the necessary tools to develop and deploy applications with [RISC Zero](https://www.risczero.com).

## Setting Up the Client

The Client is a simple React application used to interact with the CRISP Server. Follow these steps to set it up locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gnosisguild/CRISP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```sh
   cd CRISP/packages/client
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

## Setting Up the CRISP Server

The CRISP server setup involves several components. This guide will walk you through each step.

<Steps>

### Start a Local Testnet with Anvil

1. In a terminal, start a local Ethereum testnet using Anvil:

   ```sh
   anvil
   ```

Keep this terminal open and running. Open a new terminal for the next steps.

### Deploying the Enclave Contracts

1. Clone the [Enclave Repo](https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave.git
   cd enclave
   ```

2. Install the dependencies and Compile the contracts:

   ```sh
   yarn && yarn compile
   ```
3. Navigate to the `evm` directory:

   ```sh
   cd packages/evm
   ```

4. Deploy the Enclave contracts on the local testnet:

   ```sh
   yarn deploy:mocks --network localhost
   ```

After deployment, take note of the addresses for the following contracts:

- Enclave
- Ciphernode Registry
- Naive Registry Filter
- Mock Input Validator

### Deploying the E3 Program and Verifier RISC Zero Contract

1. Set up the environment variables by by exporting the Bonsai API Key:

   > **_Note:_** _You will need a Bonsai API Key. You can request one [here](https://bonsai.xyz/apply)._

   ```sh
   export BONSAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export BONSAI_API_URL="your_api_url"
   ```

2. Navigate to the `CRISP/packages/evm_base` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   cd CRISP/packages/evm_base
   yarn install
   ```

3. Navigate to the `CRISP/packages/risc0` directory and build the contracts:

   ```sh
   cd CRISP/packages/risc0
   forge build
   ```

4. In the `risc0/script` directory, update the `config.toml` with the deployed contract addresses:

   ```toml
   [profile.custom]
   chainId = 31337
   riscZeroVerifierAddress = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
   enclaveAddress = "your_enclave_address"
   inputValidatorAddress = "your_input_validator_address"
   ```

4. Export the ETH wallet private key (Anvilâ€™s default private key):

   ```sh
   export ETH_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"
   ```

5. Deploy the contracts:

   ```sh
   forge script --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast script/Deploy.s.sol
   ```

Make sure to take note of the **CRISPRisc0 Contract Address**, as this will serve as the **E3 Program Address**.

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `CRISP/packages/server` directory and fill in the values you noted during the previous steps:

```sh
CRON_API_KEY=your_cron_api_key # Optional for e3_cron binary

PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
ENCLAVE_SERVER_URL=http://0.0.0.0:4000
HTTP_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
WS_RPC_URL=ws://localhost:8545
CHAIN_ID=your_chain_id

ENCLAVE_ADDRESS=your_enclave_contract_address
E3_PROGRAM_ADDRESS=your_e3_program_address # CRISPRisc0 Contract Address
CIPHERNODE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=your_ciphernode_registry_address
NAIVE_REGISTRY_FILTER_ADDRESS=your_naive_registry_filter_address

# E3 Config
E3_WINDOW_SIZE=600
E3_THRESHOLD_MIN=1
E3_THRESHOLD_MAX=2
E3_DURATION=600

# E3 Compute Provider Config
E3_COMPUTE_PROVIDER_NAME="RISC0"
E3_COMPUTE_PROVIDER_PARALLEL=false
E3_COMPUTE_PROVIDER_BATCH_SIZE=4 # Must be a power of 2
```

</Steps>

## Overview

If you followed the steps correctly, you should now have:

- A local testnet running with Anvil
- Enclave contracts deployed
- RISC Zero E3 Program and Verifier contracts deployed
- CRISP Server set up with appropriate environment variables
