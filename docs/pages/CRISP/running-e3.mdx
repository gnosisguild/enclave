# Running an E3 Program
In this section, we will go through all the steps to run an E3 Program using CRISP.
We will run a single voting round of CRISP and do the following:
- Request an E3 Voting Round
- Submit a vote
- Compute the result
- Verify the result

Please make sure you have followed the [CRISP Setup](/CRISP/setup) guide before proceeding.


## Ciphernodes Setup

### Running Ciphernodes
In the root `enclave` directory, you have to run the Ciphernodes. To run four Ciphernodes, use the provided script [`run_ciphernodes.sh`](https://github.com/gnosisguild/CRISP/blob/main/packages/local_testnet/run_ciphernodes.sh). Ensure you run the script from the root `enclave` directory to set the environment variables correctly:
```sh
RUST_LOG=info ./run_aggregator.sh
```

### Running the Aggregator
After starting the Ciphernodes, run the aggregator with the script [`run_aggregator.sh`](https://github.com/gnosisguild/enclave/blob/main/evm/run_aggregator.sh):

```sh
RUST_LOG=info ./run_aggregator.sh
```

### Adding Ciphernodes to the Registry
Once the aggregator is running, you can add the Ciphernodes to the registry with the script [`add_ciphernodes.sh`](https://github.com/gnosisguild/CRISP/blob/main/packages/local_testnet/add_ciphernodes.sh):

```sh
./add_ciphernodes.sh
```

After running the script, you should see the following output in the aggregator terminal:
```sh
[AGG]: READY
[AGG]: CiphernodeAdded(0x2546BcD3c84621e976D8185a91A922aE77ECEc30)
[AGG]: CiphernodeAdded(0xbDA5747bFD65F08deb54cb465eB87D40e51B197E)
[AGG]: CiphernodeAdded(0xdD2FD4581271e230360230F9337D5c0430Bf44C0)
[AGG]: CiphernodeAdded(0x8626f6940E2eb28930eFb4CeF49B2d1F2C9C1199)
```


## Running the CRISP Server

To run the CRISP Server, navigate to the `CRISP/packages/server` directory and execute the following command:
> **Note:** Make sure you have set the environment variables correctly before running the server.

```sh
cargo run --bin server
```

## Interacting with CRISP via CLI

Once the Server is running, you can interact with the CRISP by using the CLI.

### Requesting a New Round


1. Run the CLI:
```sh
cargo run --bin cli
```
You should see the following output:
```sh
? Enclave (EEEE): Please choose the private execution environment you would like to run! ›  
❯ CRISP: Voting Protocol (ETH)
  More Coming Soon!
```

2. Select `CRISP: Voting Protocol (ETH)` from the menu.
```sh
❯ Initialize new E3 round.
  Activate an E3 round.
  Participate in an E3 round.
  Decrypt Ciphertext & Publish Results
```

3. To initiate a new CRISP voting round, choose the option `Initialize new CRISP round`.
```sh
✔ Initialize new E3 round.
[2024-10-22 11:56:11] [commands.rs:42] - Starting new CRISP round!
[2024-10-22 11:56:11] [commands.rs:46] - Enabling E3 Program...
[2024-10-22 11:56:11] [commands.rs:50] - E3 Program enabled. TxHash: 0xa391a4cd2dcc59f4bc6dd1f5ed1c78006dbba4556ea633f4b6a53e2271538682
[2024-10-22 11:56:11] [commands.rs:74] - E3 request sent. TxHash: 0xe7998b9748e3526f6ca992c9bb498beabe4f387b02240a23d0f42a2386d3c305
```

Ensure all services are running correctly and that components are communicating as expected before starting a new CRISP round.


### Submitting a Vote

1. Run the CLI:
```sh
cargo run --bin cli
```

2. Select the option `Participate in an E3 round`.
```sh
✔ Participate in an E3 round.
```

3. Select the round you would like to participate in.
```sh
? Enter CRISP round ID. 
❯ 0
```
4. Submit your vote by entering the vote in the prompt.
```sh
? Please select your voting option. 
❯ Abstain
  Yes
  No
```

After submitting your vote, you should see the following output:
```sh
✔ Enclave (EEEE): Please choose the private execution environment you would like to run! · CRISP: Voting Protocol (ETH)
✔ Create a new CRISP round or participate in an existing round. · Participate in an E3 round.
✔ Enter CRISP round ID. · 0
✔ Please select your voting option. · Vote yes.
[2024-10-22 11:58:58] [commands.rs:129] - Vote broadcast. TxHash: 0x389466265c543845f050aa931472840eb1d3f67276d1650aede77ce07426e98e
```

### Computing the Result
After the voting period has ended, the server will compute the result and publish the ciphertext.
```sh
[2024-10-22 11:59:12] [handlers.rs:95] - Vote Count: 1
[2024-10-22 11:59:12] [handlers.rs:101] - Starting computation for E3: 0
Prove function execution time: 2 minutes and 37 seconds
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:109] - Computation completed for E3: 0
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:110] - RISC0 Output: Risc0Output { result: ComputeResult } ...
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:111] - Publishing ciphertext...
```

### Decrypting the Result
The Ciphernodes will capture the published ciphertext, decrypt it, and publish the plaintext.
```sh
INFO Extracted log from evm sending now.
INFO evt=CiphertextOutputPublished(e3_id: 0) e3_id=0
INFO evt=DecryptionshareCreated(e3_id: 0, node: 0x2546BcD3c84621e976D8185a91A922aE77ECEc30) e3_id=0
INFO evt=PlaintextAggregated(e3_id: 0, src_chain_id: 31337) e3_id=0
INFO evt=E3RequestComplete(e3_id: 0)
INFO Plaintext published. tx=0x320dd95358cc86c2a709b6fec0c6865b43fa063cb61dfcb8a748005d4886f040
```

### Verifying the Result

The server captures the plaintext, decodes it, and displays it.

```sh
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:171] - Handling PlaintextOutputPublished event...
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:181] - Vote Count: 1
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:182] - Votes Option 1: 0
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:183] - Votes Option 2: 1
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:187] - PlaintextOutputPublished event handled.
```
