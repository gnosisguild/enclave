# Running an E3 Program

In this section, we will go through all the steps to run an E3 Program using CRISP. We will run a complete voting round of CRISP and do the following:

- Start the infrastructure (nodes and contracts)
- Start the CRISP applications (client, server, program)
- Request an E3 Voting Round
- Submit votes through the web interface
- Compute and verify results

Please make sure you have followed the [CRISP Setup](/CRISP/setup) guide before proceeding.

<Steps>

### Start Infrastructure

First, ensure you have the infrastructure running. If you haven't already, complete the setup:

**Terminal 1: Start Anvil**
```sh
anvil
```

**Terminal 2: Start Ciphernodes**
```sh
cd examples/CRISP
enclave nodes up -v
```

Make sure contracts are deployed and ciphernodes are added to the registry as described in the setup guide.

### Start the Client Application

**Terminal 3: Client**

Navigate to the client directory and start the React application:

```sh
cd examples/CRISP/client
pnpm dev
```

The client application will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Start the Server Application

**Terminal 4: Server**

Navigate to the server directory and start the backend server:

```sh
cd examples/CRISP/server
cargo run --bin server
```

The server will start and begin listening for blockchain events.

### Start the Program Server

**Terminal 5: Program**

Navigate to the program directory and start the program server:

```sh
cd examples/CRISP/program
cargo run
```

This runs the RISC Zero program server that handles secure computations.

### Initialize a New Voting Round

**Terminal 6: CLI**

Navigate to the server directory and start the CLI:

```sh
cd examples/CRISP/server
cargo run --bin cli
```

Follow these steps in the CLI:

1. Select `CRISP: Voting Protocol (ETH)` from the menu
2. Choose `Initialize new E3 round` to start a new voting round

You should see output similar to:
```sh
[2024-10-22 11:56:11] [commands.rs:42] - Starting new CRISP round!
[2024-10-22 11:56:11] [commands.rs:46] - Enabling E3 Program...
[2024-10-22 11:56:11] [commands.rs:50] - E3 Program enabled. TxHash: 0xa391a4cd2dcc59f4bc6dd1f5ed1c78006dbba4556ea633f4b6a53e2271538682
[2024-10-22 11:56:11] [commands.rs:74] - E3 request sent. TxHash: 0xe7998b9748e3526f6ca992c9bb498beabe4f387b02240a23d0f42a2386d3c305
```

### Set Up MetaMask

To interact with the client application, you need to configure MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask in your browser
2. Add the Anvil private key to your wallet:
   ```
   0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
   ```
3. Connect to the local Anvil network:
   - Network Name: Anvil Local
   - RPC URL: `http://localhost:8545`
   - Chain ID: `31337`
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`

### Submit Votes via Web Interface

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet
3. You should see the active voting round
4. Submit your vote by selecting your choice and confirming the transaction

### Monitor the Process

You can monitor the entire process through the various terminal outputs:

**Server logs will show:**
- Vote submissions being received
- Computation starting when the voting period ends
- Results being computed and published

**Example server output:**
```sh
[2024-10-22 11:59:12] [handlers.rs:95] - Vote Count: 1
[2024-10-22 11:59:12] [handlers.rs:101] - Starting computation for E3: 0
Prove function execution time: 2 minutes and 37 seconds
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:109] - Computation completed for E3: 0
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:110] - RISC0 Output: Risc0Output { result: ComputeResult } ...
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:111] - Publishing ciphertext...
```

**Ciphernode logs will show:**
```sh
INFO Extracted log from evm sending now.
INFO evt=CiphertextOutputPublished(e3_id: 0) e3_id=0
INFO evt=DecryptionshareCreated(e3_id: 0, node: 0x2546BcD3c84621e976D8185a91A922aE77ECEc30) e3_id=0
INFO evt=PlaintextAggregated(e3_id: 0, src_chain_id: 31337) e3_id=0
INFO evt=E3RequestComplete(e3_id: 0)
INFO Plaintext published. tx=0x320dd95358cc86c2a709b6fec0c6865b43fa063cb61dfcb8a748005d4886f040
```

**Final result logs:**
```sh
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:171] - Handling PlaintextOutputPublished event...
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:181] - Vote Count: 1
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:182] - Votes Option 1: 0
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:183] - Votes Option 2: 1
[2024-10-22 12:01:49] [handlers.rs:187] - PlaintextOutputPublished event handled.
```

</Steps>

## Understanding the Process

The CRISP voting process involves several key steps:

1. **Initialization**: A new E3 round is created on the blockchain
2. **Vote Submission**: Users submit encrypted votes through the web interface
3. **Computation**: After the voting period, RISC Zero computes the results using FHE
4. **Decryption**: Ciphernodes collaboratively decrypt the results
5. **Publication**: Final results are published to the blockchain and displayed

## Troubleshooting

- **Ensure all terminals remain open** during the voting process
- **MetaMask connection issues**: Check that you're connected to the correct network (Chain ID: 31337)
- **Transaction failures**: Verify you have sufficient ETH balance from the Anvil faucet
- **Server errors**: Monitor the server logs for detailed error messages
- **Ciphernode issues**: Ensure all ciphernode processes are running and connected

## Next Steps

Once you've successfully run a voting round, you can:

- **Experiment with different voting scenarios**: Try multiple votes and different options
- **Modify voting parameters**: Adjust the configuration for different use cases
- **Explore the codebase**: Understand the implementation details for your own E3 programs
- **Deploy to testnet**: Move beyond local development to public testnets
