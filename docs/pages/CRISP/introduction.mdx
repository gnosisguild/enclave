# Introduction to CRISP

CRISP (Coercion-Resistant Impartial Selection Protocol) is a secure protocol for digital decision-making, leveraging fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and distributed threshold cryptography (DTC) to enable verifiable secret ballots. Built with Enclave, CRISP safeguards democratic systems and decision-making applications against coercion, manipulation, and other vulnerabilities.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of an E3 Program, demonstrating secure and impartial decision-making processes with a modern Hardhat-based architecture. It showcases a complete full-stack implementation including frontend, backend, smart contracts, and zkVM components.

## Why CRISP?

Open ballots are known to produce suboptimal outcomes, exposing participants to bribery and coercion. CRISP mitigates these risks through:

- **Secret ballots**: Votes remain encrypted throughout the process
- **Receipt-free voting**: No proof of vote can be generated for coercion
- **Verifiable results**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure computation integrity
- **Distributed trust**: No single point of failure or control

## Project Structure

CRISP follows a modern Hardhat-based structure with clear separation of concerns:

```
CRISP/
|── client/                  # React frontend application
|── server/                  # Rust coordination server
|── program/                 # RISC Zero computation program
├── contracts/               # Smart contracts (Solidity)
├── circuits/                # Noir circuits for ZK proofs
├── scripts/                 # Development and utility scripts
├── enclave.config.yaml      # Ciphernode configuration
```

### **Client Application** (`/client`)

The client is a React application built with TypeScript that provides a voting interface:

- Wallet connection with MetaMask and other wallets
- Vote encryption using WebAssembly-based FHE encryption before submission
- Noir Zero-knowledge proof generation for vote validation
- Real-time updates on voting status and results

---

### **Coordination Server** (`/server`)

The server is a Rust-based coordination service that manages the E3 lifecycle:

- Listens to blockchain events and coordinates protocol progression
- Collects encrypted votes from the Smart Contract
- Triggers FHE computations after the voting round is closed.
- Publishes results back to the blockchain
- RESTful API for client interactions

---

### **ZK Program** (`/program`)

The core computation logic written in Rust for zkVM:

- Performs computations on encrypted votes
- Counts votes without decrypting individual ballots
- Creates proofs of correct computation

---

### **Smart Contracts** (`/contracts`)

Solidity contracts implementing the E3 program interface:

#### **CRISPProgram.sol**
Main E3 program contract implementing the `IE3Program` interface:
- `validate()`: Validates voting parameters and setup
- `verify()`: Verifies zkVM proofs of computation

#### **CRISPInputValidator.sol**
Handles vote validation and zero-knowledge proof verification:
- Validates encrypted vote format
- Verifies voter eligibility proofs
- Ensures vote uniqueness

#### **CRISPVerifier.sol**
Noir verifier for proof of correct encryption:
- Verifies if the vote was encrypted correctly
- Verifies if the vote is valid

#### **CRISPPolicy.sol**
Manages voting policies and governance:
- Defines voting rules and constraints
- Manages voter registration

#### **CRISPChecker.sol**
Additional verification and checking logic:
- Vote format validation
- Eligibility checking
- Result verification

## Next Steps

To get started with CRISP:

1. **[Setup](/CRISP/setup)**: Install dependencies and configure your environment
2. **[Running E3](/CRISP/running-e3)**: Deploy and run the complete CRISP protocol
3. **Study the code**: Examine the implementation for your own E3 programs

CRISP demonstrates the full potential of E3 programs for privacy-preserving applications, providing a complete reference implementation for developers building with Enclave.
