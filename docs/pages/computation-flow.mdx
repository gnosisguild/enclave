## Computation Flow

The computation process within Enclave is decentralized and open, allowing any participant to
contribute to each phase of execution. This design ensures transparency and flexibility, enabling
different roles to be fulfilled by various actors, including the application server, Compute
Providers, or other network participant.

### Phase 1: Request

1. **Define the E3 Program**: The core FHE logic of your application must be written in a supported
   FHE scheme. Currently, Enclave supports the [fhe.rs](https://github.com/gnosisguild/fhe.rs)
   implementation of the BFV encryption scheme.
2. **Choose a Compute Provider**: Your E3 program will likely need to be written to explicitly
   support your chosen Compute Provider. For our demo application, [CRISP](/CRISP/introduction), we
   use [Risc Zero](https://www.risczero.com/) as our Compute Provider.
3. **Specify Parameters**:
   - Set the threshold (t/n) for the Ciphernode Committee (CiCo), which defines the number of nodes
     that must coordinate to decrypt the computation output. This can be user-defined or
     pre-configured based on your application's needs.
   - Provide any necessary parameters specific to the Compute Provider.
   - Configure E3 Program parameters, including input submission deadlines and computation duration.
4. **Submit the Request**: Call `request` on the Enclave contract to publish the request and
   initialize the E3.

   ```solidity
   function request(
      address filter,
      uint32[2] calldata threshold,
      uint256[2] calldata startWindow,
      uint256 duration,
      IE3Program e3Program,
      bytes memory e3ProgramParams,
      bytes memory computeProviderParams
   ) external returns (uint256 e3Id, E3 memory e3)
   ```

### Phase 2: Node Selection

Each new request to the Enclave contracts initiates a verifiable sortition process to select a
Ciphernode Committee (CiCo). The selected Ciphernodes use the E3 Program parameters to determine the
appropriate Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme, then generate and publish a shared public
encryption key.

### Phase 3: Input Window

During this phase, Data Providers — who may include individual users, applications, or institutions
— encrypt their data to the CiCo's public key and publish commitments to those inputs onchain.

1. **Data Encryption**: Data Providers encrypt their inputs using the CiCo's public key.
2. **Input Validation**: Data Providers generate several Zero-Knowledge Proofs about their inputs to
   ensure they are valid for the requested E3. Some of these proofs are generic (e.g., proof of
   valid encryption) while others will be specific to your application.
3. **Submit Inputs**: Both encrypted data and ZKPs are submitted to the Enclave contract, which will
   call the `validateInput` function on your E3P smart contract. The input hash is then
   added to a Merkle tree, the root of which can later be used to anchor proofs of correct execution
   of your E3 Program.

   ```solidity
   function validateInput(
      address sender,
      bytes memory data
   ) external returns (bytes memory input);
   ```

### Phase 4: Execution

In this phase, the Compute Provider (CP) executes the Secure Process defined in your E3 Program and
publishes the encrypted output back to Enclave contract.

1. **Execution**: The CP retrieves encrypted inputs and executes the Secure Process defined in your
   E3 program.
2. **Publish Output**: Your E3 Program contract must implement a `verify` function that will be
   invoked by the Enclave contract to publish the ciphertext output of your computation.

   ```solidity
   function publishCiphertextOutput(
      uint256 e3Id,
      bytes memory ciphertextOutput,
      bytes memory proof
   ) external returns (bool success);
   ```

### Phase 5: Decryption

After the ciphertext output is published, the CiCo for the given E3 coordinates to decrypt the
ciphertext output and publish the resulting plaintext. The plaintext output can be queried from the
Enclave contract's `getE3()` function.

```solidity
function getE3(uint256 e3Id) external view returns (E3 memory e3);
```

or by listening to the `PlaintextOutputPublished` event.

```solidity
event PlaintextOutputPublished(uint256 indexed e3Id, bytes plaintextOutput);
```
