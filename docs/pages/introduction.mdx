## Welcome to the Enclave Developer Docs!

**Here you'll find guides, resources, and references to build with Enclave.**

If you're looking to build secure, privacy-preserving applications that compute over encrypted data
from multiple sources, you're in the right place. Enclave is an open-source protocol for **Encrypted
Execution Environments (E3)**, enabling secure and confidential computations without exposing
sensitive data.

### Why Use Enclave?

Enclave enables your application to perform computations on encrypted data, producing public results
while preserving input and intermediate-state privacy. With strong cryptoeconomic guarantees,
Enclave enables computations where sensitive inputs are never decrypted.

Key use cases include:

- **Processing Sensitive Data**: Handle personal, financial, or otherwise confidential data without
  taking custody of plaintext.
- **Meeting Regulatory Requirements**: Build applications compliant with data protection laws like
  HIPAA or GDPR.
- **Eliminating Trust Issues**: Minimized reliance on trusted parties or specialized hardware for
  securing sensitive data.

Enclave achieves this by providing a framework where data remains encrypted during computation,
leveraging a combination of advanced cryptographic techniques: **Fully Homomorphic Encryption
(FHE)**, **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, and **Distributed Threshold Cryptography (DTC)**.

### What You'll Learn

This documentation covers everything you need to get started with Enclave, including:

- Core concepts of Enclave and E3s.
- Building applications using the Enclave protocol.
- Step-by-step guides for setting up and executing computations.
- Code examples and best practices to streamline development.
